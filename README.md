> Tealy And Orangey game - Rust/WASM remake

Tealy and Orangey game was originally created by Anthony Gowland in 2011. The game was created for Flash platform, which is dead for many years now. I loved the game so much I decided to write a remake, with the perfmission from Tony. This repository is my own re-write after writing my first program in Rust :).

Enjoy!

Beta version of the game is available here:
